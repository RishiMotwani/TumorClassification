Tumor Detection (Cancerous or Not)
Project Overview

This project leverages Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify tumor samples as either cancerous (malignant) or non-cancerous (benign). Using Python and the Scikit-learn library, the model applies machine learning techniques to healthcare data for automated tumor classification.

Dataset

The dataset consists of several attributes extracted from tumor samples:

Features: Tumor attributes like radius, texture, smoothness, etc.

Target: A label indicating whether the tumor is malignant (1) or benign (0).

Steps Involved
1. Data Preprocessing

Load and inspect the dataset.

Handle any missing values.

Split the data into training and testing sets.

2. Feature Scaling

Use StandardScaler to normalize the features for optimal SVM performance.

3. Model Training

Train the SVM classifier using the preprocessed data.

4. Model Evaluation

Evaluate the model using various metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Visualize performance using a confusion matrix.

5. Hyperparameter Tuning (Optional)

Experiment with different SVM kernel functions and hyperparameters to enhance model performance.

Results

Upon running the model, you'll receive:

Classification Report: Displays accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Confusion Matrix: Shows a detailed comparison between predicted and actual labels.

Future Work

Test alternative models like Random Forest and Logistic Regression.

Use GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning.

Implement cross-validation for more robust model evaluation.
